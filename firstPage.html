        Cognitive Distortions 
    </h1>
   
    <h2>
      Have you ever convinced yourself of something that isn’t true? 
      Ever made excuses about yourself that stopped your growth and development in life? 
    </h2>

    <p> If so, it is important to understand cognitive distortion and what category you fall under. </p>
    <p>Cognitive distortions are inaccurate thoughts which are used to strengthen negative thinking.</p>
    
    <h2>Let Thought Catcher help you.</h2>
    <p>There are ten cognitive distortions:</p>




<!-- one-->
    <section id="one" class="wrapper style2 special"></section>
    <h3>
      1. The 'Black or white' Mindset
    </h3>
    <h4>You believe in one of the two extremes like failure or success and that there is no ‘grey’ areas.</h4>
    <h5>Example: although you passed your driving test, you had two minor faults and you feel like you failed because you did pass perfectly.</h5>

<!-- two-->
    <section id="two" class="wrapper style2 special">
    <h3>
      2. Jumping to Conclusions 
    </h3>
    <h4>You make pessimistic interpretations or predictions without any supporting evidence. It’s like having a crystal ball that constantly tells you negative readings. </h4>
    <h5>Example: you’re wearing a shirt that makes you feel uncomfortable and feel like everyone is commenting on it behind your back, or you apply for a promotion that you are sure you won’t get.</h5>

<!-- three-->
    <section id="three" class="wrapper style2 special">
    <h3>
      3. Overgeneralisation
    </h3>
    <h4> You come to a general conclusion based on a single incident.</h2>
    <h5> Example: you fail an exam, conclude you’re a failure and decide if you should drop out.</h5>

<!-- four-->
    <section id="four" class="wrapper style2 special">
    <h3>
      4. Catastrophisation
    </h3>
    <h4>You view an unfavourable outcome to an event and then decide that if this outcome does happen, the results will be a disaster.</h4>
    <h5>Example: you feel like you fail when you try something new, so you believe that you will fail at everything you try that you don’t have any experience in.</h5>

<!-- five-->
    <section id="five" class="wrapper style2 special">
    <h3>
      5. Mental Filter
    </h3>
    <h4> You take the negative details and magnify them while also filtering out all positives of a situation.</h4>
    <h5> Example: you’re a Youtuber and one of your videos attract loads of positive comments from your fans, however, you notice a bad comment and you only focus on that. </h5>

<!-- six--> 
    <section id="six" class="wrapper style2 special">
    <h3>
      6. Diminishing the Positive
    </h3>
    <h4>You disqualify all the positives, coming up with several reasons why the positive events in your life do not count. </h4>
    <h5>Example: you believe you got ‘lucky’ and that is the reason why you got promoted, not because of your successes. </h5>

<!-- seven-->
    <section id="seven" class="wrapper style2 special"></section>
    <h3>
      7. Personalisation
    </h3>
    <h4>You believe that everything others say or do is some kind of direct, personal reaction to you. You often compare yourself to others and you take things personally even when it was not meant that way.   </h4>
    <h5>Example: you’re having a retirement party and because your brother was late, you feel like this caused your guessed to not enjoy it.  </h5>

<!-- eight-->   
    <section id="eight" class="wrapper style2 special">
    <h3>
      8. Shoulds 
    </h3>
    <h4>You follow a bunch of rules about how someone ‘should’ behave, when you break one of these rules you feel either angry or guilty that you’ve failed. </h4>
    <h5>Example: you should eat healthy and that you shouldn’t eat any takeaways. </h5>

<!-- nine-->
    <section id="nine" class="wrapper style2 special"></section>
    <h3>
      9. Emotional Reasoning
    </h3>
    <h4>You feel a certain way and assume that it is true. This may lead to you ignoring rationality and logic when you make your assumptions. </h4>
    <h5>Example: You feel like a failure, so you must be a failure. </h5>

<!-- ten--> 
    <section id="ten" class="wrapper style2 special"></section>   
    <h3>
      10. Universal Labelling
    </h3>
    <h4>Instead of describing a mistake in context of a particular situation, you assign an unhealthy label on yourself or others. This is a mixture of stereotyping and overgeneralisation. </h4>
    <h5>Example: you mislabel your colleague as ‘difficult and rude’ when you met him once at a company conference without bothering to understand any context around why. </h5>
