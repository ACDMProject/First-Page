    Cognitive Distortions
  </h1>

  <h2>
    Have you ever convinced yourself of something that isn’t true?
    Ever made excuses about yourself that stopped your growth and development in life?
  </h2>

  <p> If so, it is important to understand cognitive distortion and what category you fall under. </p>
  <p>Cognitive distortions are inaccurate thoughts which are used to strengthen negative thinking.</p>

  <h2>Let Thought Catcher help you.</h2>
  <p>There are ten cognitive distortions:</p>

    <h3>
      1. The 'Black and White' Mindset
    </h3>
    <h4>
    <div class="img1"><img src="Black-and-White.png" alt="First Mindset" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;" > </div>
    You believe in one of the two extremes like failure or success and that there is no ‘grey’ areas.
  </h4>
    <h5>Example: although you passed your driving test, you had two minor faults and you feel like you failed because
      you did pass perfectly.</h5>

      2. Jumping to Conclusions
    </h3>
    <h4>
    <div class="img2"><img src="JumpingToConclusions.png" alt="Second Mindset" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;" > </div>
    You make pessimistic interpretations or predictions without any supporting evidence. It’s like having a
    crystal ball that constantly tells you negative readings. </h4>
    
    <h5>Example: you’re wearing a shirt that makes you feel uncomfortable and feel like everyone is commenting on it
      behind your back, or you apply for a promotion that you are sure you won’t get.</h5>
